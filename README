Create a progressively-enhanced comic using CSS Animations

- must have at least 3 panels

- must use original artwork (I don't care if it's done in MS Paint, as long as you make it)

- comic must render normally for browsers that don't support CSS animations - use modernizr CSS selectors

- panels should render one after another - use delays to stagger the animations

- at least one animation must have more than two frames

- create a nice, simple layout for the page
